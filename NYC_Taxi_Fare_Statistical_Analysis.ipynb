Without this assumption, we cannot draw causal conclusions about how payment method affects fare amount.\n","\n","**The goal** is to apply descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing in Python. The goal for this A/B test is to sample data and analyze whether there is a relationship between payment type and fare amount. For example: discover if customers who use credit cards pay higher fare amounts than customers who use cash.\n","  \n","*This activity has four parts:*\n","\n","**Part 1:** Imports and data loading\n","* What data packages will be necessary for hypothesis testing?\n","\n","**Part 2:** Conduct EDA and hypothesis testing\n","* How did computing descriptive statistics help you analyze your data?\n","\n","* How did you formulate your null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis?\n","\n","**Part 3:** Communicate insights with stakeholders\n","\n","* What key business insight(s) emerged from your A/B test?\n","\n","* What business recommendations do you propose based on your results?\n","\n","<br/>\n","Follow the instructions and answer the questions below to complete the activity.

This project requires an assumption that passengers were forced to pay one way or the other, and that once informed of this requirement, they always complied with it. The data was not collected this way; so, an assumption had to be made to randomly group data entries to perform an A/B test. This dataset does not account for other likely explanations. For example, riders might not carry lots of cash, so it's easier to pay for longer/farther trips with a credit card. In other words, it's far more likely that fare amount determines payment type, rather than vice versa."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EB34ZCWIztFZ"},"source":["**Congratulations!** You've completed this lab.
