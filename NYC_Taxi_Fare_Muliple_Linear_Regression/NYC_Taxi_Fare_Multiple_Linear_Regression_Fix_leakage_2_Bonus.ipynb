As such, there are some things to note that differ from best practice or from how tasks are typically performed.\n","\n","1.  When the `mean_distance` and `mean_duration` columns were computed, the means were calculated from the entire dataset. These same columns were then used to train a model that was used to predict on a test set. A test set is supposed to represent entirely new data that the model has not seen before, but in this case, some of its predictor variables were derived using data that *was* in the test set.</br></br>\n","This is known as **<u>data leakage</u>**. Data leakage is when information from your training data contaminates the test data. If your model has unexpectedly high scores, there is a good chance that there was some data leakage.\n","</br></br>\n","To avoid data leakage in this modeling process, it would be best to compute the means using only the training set and then copy those into the test set, thus preventing values from the test set from being included in the computation of the means. This would have created some problems because it's very likely that some combinations of pickup-dropoff locations would only appear in the test data (not the train data). This means that there would be NaNs in the test data, and further steps would be required to address this.\n","</br></br>\n","In this case, the data leakage improved the R<sup>2</sup> score by ~0.03.\n","</br></br>\n","2. Imputing the fare amount for `RatecodeID 2` after training the model and then calculating model performance metrics on the post-imputed data is not best practice. It would be better to separate the rides that did *not* have rate codes of 2, train the model on that data specifically, and then add the `RatecodeID 2` data (and its imputed rates) *after*. This would prevent training the model on data that you don't need a model for, and would likely result in a better final model. However, the steps were combined for simplicity.\n","</br></br>\n","3. Models that predict values to be used in another downstream model are common in data science workflows. When models are deployed, the data cleaning, imputations, splits, predictions, etc. are done using modeling pipelines. Pandas was used here to granularize and explain the concepts of certain steps, but this process would be streamlined by machine learning engineers. The ideas are the same, but the implementation would differ. Once a modeling workflow has been validated, the entire process can be automated, often with no need for pandas and no need to examine outputs at each step. This entire process would be reduced to a page of code."],"metadata":{"id":"PteXc-gn3zPp"}}]}
